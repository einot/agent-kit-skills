#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Generic PreToolUse Bash guard shared by this project's subagents
# (.claude/agents/*.md). This is the Bash counterpart of path-guard.sh:
# each agent's policy is set as env vars inline on the hook's own
# command line in `.claude/settings.json` (see WIRING below -- not in
# the agent file), so the same script is parametrized per-agent instead
# of duplicating the same policy in every agent definition.
#
# RULE IDs. Citations of the form "ADR-0018 decision N" name rules in the
# design record of the project this kit was extracted from. They are kept
# as stable identifiers rather than removed: the kit's behaviour tests
# (tests/hooks/) cite the same numbers, so a failing test and the rule it
# exercises stay cross-referenced. Every rule's rationale is restated in
# this header; the record itself is not needed to understand it.
#
# The guard is DEFAULT-DENY: a command runs only if every command name in
# it was named by the agent's own allowlist.
#
# Env vars (space-separated lists):
#
#   ALLOW_CMDS         - permitted command names, matched against argv[0]
#                        of every segment of the command. Anything else is
#                        DENIED. Unset or empty means no Bash guard is in
#                        force for this agent (the same "unguarded agent"
#                        shape path-guard.sh uses) and the command passes.
#   ALLOW_GIT_SUBCMDS  - permitted `git` subcommands. Only consulted when
#                        `git` is in ALLOW_CMDS; empty with `git` allowed
#                        denies every git subcommand.
#   ALLOW_NODE_SCRIPTS - glob list of script paths `node` may execute
#                        (`[[ str == pattern ]]` semantics, so a bare `*`
#                        in a pattern matches across `/` too). Checked
#                        against the path as written on the command line
#                        and against the path made relative to
#                        `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$cwd}`. Only consulted
#                        when `node` is in ALLOW_CMDS.
#   SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES  - agent types this policy applies to, matched
#                        against the payload's `agent_type`. Unset or
#                        empty polices every Bash call that reaches this
#                        hook (the historical behaviour). Set polices
#                        only the listed agents and passes every other
#                        caller through untouched. See WIRING below --
#                        this exists because the hook has to be
#                        installed session-wide.
#
# ADR-0018 (docs/adr/0018-coder-bash-policy-literal-commands-and-a-tripwire.md)
# adds five more. Every one is off unless a policy sets it, and with all
# five unset every rule and message below behaves as it did before them.
#
#   LITERAL_ONLY         - `1` turns on literal mode (see LITERAL MODE
#                          below): one lexical check, run before every
#                          other check, that refuses anything bash would
#                          rewrite. Empty or unset is off. Any other value
#                          is a configuration error that refuses every
#                          command. The uv and make rules, git
#                          add/commit/merge and ruff's write mode run only
#                          in literal mode; a policy that reaches one of
#                          them without it gets a configuration error.
#   DENY_ADVICE          - unset, empty or `needs-validation` keeps every
#                          message exactly as it was. `stop-and-report`
#                          appends ADR-0018 decision 11's paragraph
#                          ("This refusal is final for this task. ...")
#                          after one space to EVERY denial, configuration
#                          errors and shared rules included, and rewords
#                          the two auditor-specific messages (a command not
#                          on ALLOW_CMDS, a git subcommand not on
#                          ALLOW_GIT_SUBCMDS) without their
#                          needs-validation sentences. Any other non-empty
#                          value behaves as `stop-and-report`.
#   ALLOW_UV_RUN_TARGETS - targets `uv run` may launch. Every entry must
#                          also be on this script's own UV_RUN_KNOWN_TARGETS
#                          (`pytest ruff`), the targets it has rules for;
#                          any other entry is a configuration error.
#   ALLOW_MAKE_TARGETS   - the make targets allowed, one per command.
#   WRITE_DENY_GLOBS     - glob list (`[[ str == pattern ]]` semantics, as
#                          in path-guard.sh) of paths `ruff format` may not
#                          rewrite in write mode. It is meant to equal the
#                          agent's Edit/Write DENY_GLOBS, so that a write
#                          launched from Bash respects the same fence as a
#                          Write. Empty or unset refuses write mode
#                          altogether.
#
# Reads the PreToolUse JSON payload on stdin (see
# https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) and inspects tool_input.command.
# Any tool other than Bash passes through. A payload this guard cannot read
# is refused first, for every caller (see PAYLOAD SHAPE below).
#
# A GUARD THAT FAILS DENIES (ADR-0018 decision 19, fifth amendment). This
# script ends with status 0 (allow, with no output) or 2 (deny) and nothing
# else. Before this, any command that failed under `set -e` -- an
# extraction line whose jq could not read the payload, or the jq inside
# `deny` -- ended the script with some other status, which the harness
# treats as a non-blocking hook error, so the call went through. Three
# parts, built in for every policy, with no knob:
#
#   FAIL-CLOSED EXIT. An EXIT trap, installed as the first command after
#   `set -f -e -u -o pipefail`, turns any exit status other than 0 or 2
#   into the backstop denial ("... the guard stopped with status N before
#   reaching a verdict ...") and exit 2. It writes the JSON deny with
#   printf and a fixed template, never with jq, which may be what failed.
#   It carries no DENY_ADVICE paragraph, in any mode, because it can fire
#   before the knobs are read: it is the one exception to decision 11's
#   "every denial".
#
#   DENY'S FALLBACK. `deny` still writes the JSON deny with `jq -n` and
#   exits 2. If that jq fails, it writes the same reason, the DENY_ADVICE
#   paragraph included, to stderr instead, and still exits 2, which blocks
#   whether or not JSON is printed.
#
#   PAYLOAD SHAPE. Between reading stdin and the first extraction line, one
#   `jq -e -s` call over the raw payload asks whether it is malformed. It
#   is well formed when it is exactly one JSON value, that value is an
#   object, its tool_input is an object, its tool_name is a string, and its
#   cwd and agent_type are each a string, null or absent. Only status 1 (a
#   clean false: well formed) passes; status 0 (malformed) and any other
#   status (not JSON, or jq failed) get the shape denial ("... could not be
#   read as a single tool call ..."), which names the status and goes
#   through `deny`. This is the one check in the script that runs BEFORE
#   the tool_name test and the SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES routing, for every caller
#   the hook sees, the top-level session included, and under a policy that
#   constrains nothing: the routing reads agent_type through an extraction
#   line, so a script that cannot read the payload cannot tell whether the
#   caller is in scope. `deny`, DENY_ADVICE and FINAL_PARAGRAPH are
#   therefore defined above the extraction lines. A field inside tool_input
#   is not this check's business: a command that is not a string still
#   meets the NUL gate's could-not-be-checked denial. Once the shape passes,
#   no extraction line can fail on the payload, only through the
#   environment, and the trap turns that into the backstop denial.
#
#   The cost: a missing or broken jq now refuses every call this hook sees,
#   the top-level session's included, until jq is restored from outside
#   the session. A guard process that never finishes (killed by a signal
#   or by the hook timeout), or a hook command that cannot start, is
#   outside what the script can do.
#
# WIRING -- read this before believing the guard is doing anything.
#
# This hook must be wired in `.claude/settings.json` or
# `.claude/settings.local.json`. It must NOT be wired in an agent file's
# `hooks:` frontmatter. A guard declared there did not fire in this
# environment -- observed three times -- so an agent configured that way
# ran completely unfenced with no error anywhere. The docs list `hooks`
# as a supported frontmatter field but require workspace trust for a
# project-level agent's frontmatter hooks, and this project has no trust
# record; that is the best-supported explanation and has not been
# confirmed directly. The guard had been reviewed nine times without
# once being invoked. The smoke test that caught it was the wired
# security-auditor successfully running `sed -n 1,2p CHANGES`, with `sed`
# absent from its ALLOW_CMDS.
#
#   * agent-file `hooks:` frontmatter -- does NOT fire. Three probes: the
#     real agent, a throwaway file-based probe with an absolute hook
#     path, and the same probe with ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}. All three ran
#     the command that should have been denied.
#   * inline `--agents` JSON hooks -- DO fire, including `VAR='x' /path`
#     env assignments and ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}.
#   * settings.json / settings.local.json hooks -- DO fire for subagent
#     Bash calls, and ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR} expands there.
#
# Settings-level hooks are session-wide, so they see every Bash call in
# the session and not just the agent you meant to fence. That is what
# SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES is for: the payload's `agent_type` names the caller
# ("security-auditor" for that subagent, absent for a top-level call), so
# a policy can be aimed at the agent it was written for.
#
# One entry carries one policy. The env vars come from the hook's own
# command line, so two agents needing different allowlists need two
# settings entries, each with its own SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES and its own
# ALLOW_CMDS; there is no way to express two policies in one entry. Two
# entries whose SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES overlap would both run, and the
# stricter one's denial wins, since any deny is final.
#
# Two properties of this arrangement. Both are things a reader needs to
# know, and neither is a safety claim:
#
#   SCOPING IS FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN. An absent or unrecognised agent_type
#   means "not my business", not "deny". It is routing, not a check. This
#   guard exists to fence one agent against one policy; every other
#   caller is governed by its own configuration, or by Claude Code's own
#   sandbox. A version that denied unrecognised callers would break the
#   session it was installed in and would still not be a security
#   boundary for them, because it knows nothing about what they may do.
#   So do not read an exit 0 here as approval -- for an out-of-scope
#   caller it means only that this policy did not apply.
#
#   THE GUARD IS INERT UNLESS CONFIGURED, and that is the failure mode
#   that cost nine rounds. An empty ALLOW_CMDS exits 0. An unmatched
#   agent_type now exits 0. A hook wired in agent frontmatter did not
#   run at all in this environment (see WIRING). From outside, all three
#   are indistinguishable from a working guard: the command simply
#   succeeds. Reading the settings file is not enough either, because it
#   does not tell you the hook was reached. The only way to know it is
#   live is to run a command that MUST be denied and look at the
#   refusal: it has to say "bash guard:". If it instead says
#   "Claude Code may only write to files in the allowed working
#   directories", that is the platform sandbox and this guard is not
#   running. Do that check after any change to the wiring, and treat a
#   silent success on a command that should be refused as evidence the
#   fence is missing rather than as a pass.
#
#   A POLICY MUST NEVER BE WIRED BEFORE THE SCRIPT THAT IMPLEMENTS IT
#   (ADR-0018 decision 13). A policy can depend on features of this
#   script -- the coder's depends on literal mode and the uv, make and
#   git add/commit/merge rules. Hook scripts are read from the main
#   checkout, at ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/bash-guard.sh, so
#   the script that implements a policy must be the file there before
#   the policy goes into settings.json. A script that predates those
#   rules has no uv or make rule at all: wired to it, the coder's
#   policy would admit `uv run python -c ...` while looking closed. The
#   known-command check (see Caveat) makes a FUTURE policy fail closed
#   when it is wired early, by refusing any command this script has no
#   model for, but it cannot protect a transition to a script that does
#   not have that check yet.
#
# What it enforces beyond the name allowlist: the whole command is
# rejected if it contains redirection, backgrounding, process
# substitution, a backtick, any `$` (shell expansion of any kind), a
# brace (bash would expand it into extra words after this hook returns)
# or a newline, because each of those either writes a file, hides a
# second command from inspection, or changes the command after it has
# been inspected. What is left is split on `|`, `;`, `&&` and
# `||`, and every segment is validated on its own, so a pipeline runs only
# if each stage is independently allowed. Per-command rules then strip the
# file-writing and code-executing options that a few otherwise read-only
# tools carry: `sort -o`/`--compress-program`, `find -exec`/`-delete`,
# `git --output`/`-O`/`--help`, `rg --pre`, `file -C`. Three commands are
# handled by allowlist instead, because for them a denylist is
# structurally unsound (see POSITIONAL RULES below): `sed` may use only
# valueless options and a print-only script, `git` may use only a short
# list of valueless global options before its subcommand, and `node` may
# use no options at all before its script path -- which must additionally
# be a literal path, with no glob character and no leading `~`, because
# it is the only path this guard vets by value and bash would otherwise
# expand it into a different path after approval.
#
# LITERAL MODE (LITERAL_ONLY='1', ADR-0018 decision 3). One lexical check
# runs before every other check and refuses a command that contains,
# anywhere: a newline, `$`, a backtick, `\`, `'`, `"`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`,
# `(`, `)`, `*`, `?`, `<`, `>`, `#`; an `&` that is not part of `&&`;
# any C0 control character other than tab and newline (0x01-0x08, 0x0B,
# 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x0E-0x1F) and DEL (0x7F); or a word that begins with `~`
# or contains `=~` or `:~`. For that last
# test words are split on blanks and on `|`, `;` and `&`, because bash
# starts a new word after a separator whether or not a blank follows.
# What is left can only be words of ordinary characters separated by
# blanks and by `|`, `;`, `&&` and `||`. On such a string bash removes no
# quotes, performs no brace, tilde, parameter, command, arithmetic or
# process expansion, has no expansion result to word-split, globs nothing
# (extended globs need `(`), and recognises no comment, redirection or
# grouping. So the words split out below are exactly the argv each tool
# receives, and each segment is exactly one simple command; a reserved
# word at the start of a segment is simply not on ALLOW_CMDS. `HEAD~1`,
# `--tb=short`, `a:b` and `x@y` remain available. The denial says `must
# be literal` and names the supported forms: the Grep and Glob tools,
# `git commit -F .commit-msg`, `-k WORD`, and that stderr is captured.
#
# The control-character refusal (second amendment) is invariant hygiene
# rather than a closed exec path. Such bytes mostly fail closed already:
# an exact-match rule rejects a token carrying one (`pytest\r` is not
# `pytest`), and neither present-flag rule fires on a flag carrying one
# (`--check\r` is not `--check`, so ruff format stays in write mode and
# is refused). Refusing them outright makes "words of ordinary
# characters" literally true, and keeps the transcript that the tripwire
# relies on faithful: a carriage return can make a logged command line
# render as something other than what ran. Tab stays allowed because it
# is one of bash's blanks and this guard splits on it exactly as bash
# does. The bytes are enumerated, not matched with a locale-dependent
# range. The refusal is the ordinary literal-mode denial, naming "a
# control character other than tab". It applies only in literal mode:
# the auditor's deny-only policy has no relaxation for one to subvert.
#
# NUL GATE, IN EVERY MODE (ADR-0018 decision 3, second amendment). Before
# the empty-command exit and before literal mode, independent of
# LITERAL_ONLY, a command whose decoded tool_input.command contains a NUL
# (U+0000) is refused. The reason is the extraction every policy shares:
# command_str comes from a command substitution, which silently drops NUL
# bytes, so the string every other rule vets may not be the command the
# harness runs -- `uv run --locked ruff format<NUL> --check .` would be
# vetted as read-only. The gate therefore does NOT trust command_str. It
# runs `jq -e '(.tool_input.command // "") | explode | any(. == 0)'` over
# the raw payload and reads jq's EXIT STATUS, because any captured string
# would pass through the same NUL-stripping. Status 1 (a clean false) is
# the only pass; 0 denies as a NUL; any other status -- a jq error, such
# as `explode` on a command that is a number, array or object -- denies
# as "could not be checked". The status is captured explicitly, because
# `set -e` does not act inside an `if` condition and would otherwise let
# every jq error through as "no NUL". An absent or null command becomes
# the empty string, passes, and exits 0 at the empty-command check as
# before. This is the one refusal the amendment adds to the auditor.
#
# Literal mode is what the ADR-0018 rules stand on, and they run only in
# it:
#
#   * uv (decision 5): only `uv run`, nothing between `uv` and `run`;
#     between `run` and the target only `--locked` and `--offline`,
#     matched exactly (both valueless, so the first word without a dash
#     IS the target); the target on ALLOW_UV_RUN_TARGETS and on
#     UV_RUN_KNOWN_TARGETS; the shadow check (below); the target's own
#     rule; and LAST, `--locked` required among uv's options. Last,
#     because that denial corrects a form instead of refusing a
#     capability, so it is only ever given to a command that is allowed
#     as soon as `--locked` is added, and it names that command.
#   * Shadowing (decisions 5 and 8): every uv and make command is refused
#     while the payload's cwd holds an entry of any type named pytest,
#     ruff, mypy, GNUmakefile or makefile, and when the payload carries
#     no cwd. uv runs a same-named directory with __main__.py, or a
#     zipapp, in place of the tool, and make reads GNUmakefile and
#     makefile before Makefile. This is defence in depth behind the
#     Edit/Write fence, which refuses to create those names: a check
#     against the live filesystem has a window when a Write and a Bash
#     call are issued together.
#   * pytest (decision 6) and ruff (decision 7): exact-match option
#     allowlists, and EVERY word checked -- none skipped as an option's
#     value -- so the guard never models which options take values. A
#     pytest operand must be a relative directory or a test_*.py /
#     *_test.py file (with or without ::node ids), because pytest imports
#     any .py and doctests any .txt/.rst named on its command line.
#     `ruff format` without `--check`/`--diff` is write mode: explicit
#     .py/.pyi files only, none matching WRITE_DENY_GLOBS.
#   * make (decision 8): exactly `make TARGET`, TARGET on
#     ALLOW_MAKE_TARGETS, then the shadow check.
#   * git add, commit and merge (decision 9): an option allowlist each,
#     over every word after the subcommand; `merge` requires --ff-only.
#     Every existing git rule still applies first.
#
# BASH EXPANSIONS -- the layer underneath every option rule in this file.
# Everything below reasons about how a TOOL parses its arguments. That is
# only half the problem: this guard inspects a STRING, and bash rewrites
# that string before any tool starts. Seven rounds of review missed a
# live write-and-exec bypass for exactly this reason. Every round
# compared the guard's model of a tool's parser against the real parser,
# and none asked what bash does to the command between this hook
# returning "allow" and the binary starting. The answer was brace
# expansion, and through the shipping allowlist it deleted a file, wrote
# a 212KB file and executed a script. So when adding a rule here, ask the
# question in BOTH directions: does the tool read this token the way I
# think it does, and will this token still be this token when the tool
# runs?
#
# Bash's word expansions, in the order bash applies them, with where each
# one stands here. Every "REJECTED" names the check that does it.
#
#   1. Brace expansion -- `{a,b}`, `{1..9}`
#      REJECTED whole-command, by the brace check. It has to be: it
#      invents new words after this hook has already answered.
#   2. Tilde expansion -- `~`, `~user`, `~+`, `~-`
#      NOT rejected in general; bounded by what it can produce, except in
#      the one path-vetting rule, where it is rejected outright. Every
#      form expands to an absolute path (verified: `~` -> /root,
#      `~+` -> $PWD, `~-` -> $OLDPWD, `~root` -> /root), so it cannot
#      introduce a leading `-` and cannot turn an operand into an option.
#      The bound fails only if HOME itself begins with `-`, and the agent
#      cannot set HOME -- a leading VAR=value is denied by the argv[0]
#      `=` rule. Only a LEADING `~` expands at all: bash leaves
#      `--foo=~/x` and `x~/y` alone (verified).
#
#      It does reach outside the repository. To be precise about what
#      that means here, because an earlier version of this row said "this
#      guard has no path scoping at all" and that is not quite true: this
#      guard scopes exactly ONE path, node's script, via
#      ALLOW_NODE_SCRIPTS and relative_to_project. Nothing else is path
#      scoped -- `cat /etc/passwd` is allowed, and restricting that is
#      path-guard.sh's job, which does not see Bash. For the one path
#      that IS scoped, a tilde would be vetted as written and run
#      expanded, so check_node rejects a leading `~` there; see the
#      comment on that rejection for why it is worth doing even though
#      the shipping config denies `node ~/x.js` anyway.
#   3. Parameter expansion -- `$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `${VAR:-x}`
#      REJECTED whole-command, by the `$` check.
#   4. Command substitution -- `$(cmd)`, backticks
#      REJECTED whole-command, by the `$` check and by `` ` `` in the
#      forbidden loop.
#   5. Arithmetic expansion -- `$((1+1))`
#      REJECTED whole-command, by the `$` check.
#   6. Process substitution -- `<(cmd)`, `>(cmd)`
#      REJECTED whole-command, by `>(` and `<(` in the forbidden loop,
#      and independently by the bare `>` and `<` entries.
#   7. Word splitting -- splitting expansion results on IFS
#      NOT rejected, and it cannot act. It splits only the results of 3,
#      4 and 5, every one of which is rejected; it never touches literal
#      text. With those rejected, nothing can hand it a word to split.
#   8. Pathname expansion / globbing -- `*`, `?`, `[a-z]`
#      NOT rejected in general, and it cannot be: the guard is quote-blind
#      and `find services -name "*.py"` is core usage, so rejecting `*`
#      would reject the tools' own quoted patterns too. Three separate
#      things therefore have to hold, and they are discharged in three
#      different ways:
#
#      (a) It must not inject an OPTION. A glob expands only to names
#          that already exist, so it can produce a word starting with `-`
#          only if such a file already exists in the globbed directory.
#          Verified both ways: with a file named `-i` deliberately
#          created, `*` does expand to `-i`; no such file existed in the
#          worktree or /tmp when this was checked. This is the one bound
#          resting on the FILESYSTEM rather than on this guard, and the
#          reason it holds is that the agent has no write primitive with
#          which to create such a file -- which is what the rest of this
#          file is for. Treat the filesystem check as evidence from one
#          point in time; the argument, not the check, is the bound.
#
#          FOR A LITERAL POLICY THIS BOUND IS REPLACED, NOT RELIED ON.
#          Its argument fails for an agent that CAN write: a coder could
#          create a file named `--pre=sh` and run `rg x *`, and bash would
#          hand rg `--pre=sh`. Under LITERAL_ONLY='1' no `*`, `?`, `[` or
#          `]` reaches bash at all, so no glob expands and the filesystem
#          plays no part. Any policy fencing an agent with Edit or Write
#          must be literal for this reason alone.
#      (b) It must not inject a SECOND COMMAND. Expansion results are not
#          re-scanned as shell syntax: files named `a;b` and `c|d` are
#          passed as single arguments, not as separators (verified).
#      (c) It must not change a path that a rule vetted BY VALUE. This
#          one is not bounded by argument -- it is REJECTED, in
#          check_node, which is the only rule that matches a path value
#          (the only caller of matches_any). A glob character in node's
#          script path is denied there, because a glob on
#          ALLOW_NODE_SCRIPTS would otherwise let a glob token be
#          approved and expanded afterwards (verified, and denied now).
#          Every other value comparison in the file is exact-string
#          `in_list`, where a glob character simply fails to match and so
#          fails closed by itself.
#   9. Quote removal
#      MODELLED rather than rejected: normalize_token deletes `'`, `"`
#      and `\` so the rules compare what the tool will actually receive.
#      See TOKEN NORMALIZATION next, and the two text divergences under
#      POSITIONAL RULES where the model and bash still differ. Under
#      LITERAL_ONLY='1' it is REJECTED instead: no quote or backslash
#      survives the literal check, so there is nothing to remove, and a
#      leading tilde (row 2) is rejected too.
#
# Not expansions, but the same class of after-the-fact rewriting, for
# completeness: alias and history expansion are both off in the
# non-interactive shell the Bash tool uses (verified: expand_aliases
# off, histexpand off), and an alias needs an `=` the argv[0] rule denies
# in any case. Redirection is rejected by the forbidden loop. `;`, `|`,
# `&&` and `||` are handled by segment splitting, a bare `&` is
# rejected, and a newline is rejected.
#
# TOKEN NORMALIZATION (load-bearing, not cosmetic): every `'`, `"` and `\`
# character is deleted from a token before ANY comparison this script
# makes -- the argv[0] `=` and `/` checks, the ALLOW_CMDS lookup, every
# per-command option rule, the git subcommand lookup and the node script
# path match all run on the normalized token, not on the text as typed.
# Bash performs quote removal before a command ever sees its arguments, so
# `sed -"i"`, `sed "-i"`, `sed -i""`, `find -exe"c"` and `sort -"o"` are
# simply `sed -i`, `find -exec` and `sort -o` by the time they run.
# Matching the text as typed let any partially quoted spelling of a denied
# option walk straight through the option rules and write files, which is
# the one thing this guard exists to prevent. Deleting quote and backslash
# characters can only shorten a token, so where it diverges from bash's
# own quote removal it errs towards a name bash could not have executed
# at all, never towards letting a denied binary through. The divergence
# needs the backslash itself to be quoted: `'c\at'` stays `c\at` for bash
# and is not a command, while it normalizes to `cat` here. (Unquoted
# `c\at` is no divergence at all -- bash's own quote removal makes that
# `cat` too, exactly as this function does.) That reasoning is about
# command NAMES and option spellings. For sed's script, where the token
# is compared against a shape rather than a list, the same deletion
# produces a text divergence that is documented as divergence 2 under
# POSITIONAL RULES below.
#
# OPTION SPELLING: a rule that names one spelling of an option catches
# almost nothing, because the tools accept several. Three spellings are
# handled explicitly, each verified against the binaries installed here:
#
#   * Short-option clusters are walked letter by letter, because getopt
#     reads them that way: `sort -no FILE` still writes FILE even though
#     the token does not start with `-o`, and attached values
#     (`sort -o/tmp/x`) count too. sort and file use short_cluster_has,
#     which stops at the first letter whose argument swallows the rest of
#     the token. sed is stricter and uses neither: every letter of a
#     cluster must be on its valueless allowlist, so `sed -ni` is denied
#     for containing a letter that is not on the list, not for being
#     recognized as in-place editing.
#   * Long options are matched as PREFIXES wherever a rule names one,
#     because GNU getopt_long and git's parse-options accept any
#     unambiguous abbreviation: `sort --o out` writes a file and
#     `sed --in FILE` rewrites one in place (both verified). sort, git,
#     node, rg and file use that prefix matcher -- see long_opt_matches.
#     sed does NOT, and the example above is deliberately kept because
#     the sed behaviour is what makes the point: sed reaches the same
#     result by the stricter route of an exact-match allowlist
#     (sed_option_allowed), so `--in` is refused there for not being on
#     the list, rather than for abbreviating `--in-place`.
#   * `--` ends option parsing, which moves where a tool's OPERANDS
#     start. Only the three rules that care about operand position
#     (sed's script, git's subcommand, node's script path) treat it
#     specially; see each check_* for what it does and why. The option
#     rules otherwise keep scanning past `--`, which can only over-deny
#     an operand that looks like a denied option, and that fails closed.
#     There is one exception, and it follows from the positional rule
#     rather than weakening it: check_sed claims the first token after a
#     `--` as the script before its option rule sees it, so
#     `sed -n -- -i 1p FILE` never reaches sed_option_allowed at all. It
#     is still denied, because the print-only shape admits only `N[,M]p`
#     and `/re/p` and therefore rejects every `-`-prefixed token anyway
#     -- and denied with the right diagnosis, since `-i` is exactly what
#     sed takes as its script there. Scanning every token also covers
#     GNU's argument permutation, where an option placed after an operand
#     still applies (`sed 's/a/b/' FILE -i` edits in place; verified).
#
# No rule waives a check because some flag is PRESENT. That pattern was
# tried once (accepting any sed script when `--sandbox` appeared) and it
# broke exactly as this kind of rule always does: `sed -n --
# '1e printf PWNED' --sandbox FILE` put `--sandbox` after `--`, where sed
# reads it as a filename and never enables sandbox mode, while the guard
# read it as an option and waived the script check. A rule of the form
# "allow because a good flag is present" puts the boundary inside the
# guarded binary's parser; only "deny because a bad token is present"
# keeps it here.
#
# Outside literal mode that rule is absolute. Inside it there are exactly
# two present-flag rules, both from ADR-0018: `ruff format` is read-only
# when `--check` or `--diff` is present (decision 7), and `git merge` is
# allowed only when `--ff-only` is present (decision 9). They are sound
# there, and only there, because all three of these hold, and the sed
# failure above broke the second:
#
#   * literal mode makes the word the guard sees the word the tool gets;
#   * `--` is refused by both rules, so the flag cannot be demoted to an
#     operand;
#   * every option either rule allows is valueless, so nothing can
#     consume the flag as its value.
#
# Drop any one of those and the rule must go with it.
#
# POSITIONAL RULES: three rules do still depend on WHICH token is an
# operand rather than an option -- sed's script, git's subcommand and
# node's script path. Such a rule is sound only when every option that
# could consume the next token is already denied; otherwise the tool eats
# what the guard called an operand as an option's VALUE, and the guard is
# left reasoning about the wrong token. An earlier version of this file
# got that wrong twice, in both cases allowing arbitrary command
# execution (both verified, not theoretical):
#
#   git --namespace log -c diff.external=SCRIPT diff HEAD~1
#       git consumes `log` as the value of --namespace, so the guard
#       booked `log` as the subcommand, found it allowed, and switched
#       off its pre-subcommand denials while git went on to parse `-c`.
#   sed -l 1,40p '1e printf PWNED' FILE
#       GNU sed accepts `1,40p` as the -l value (strtoul stops at the
#       comma without complaining), so the guard checked the print-only
#       shape against `1,40p` while sed ran `1e printf PWNED`.
#
# Enumerating the value-taking options that could do this failed twice,
# because the enumeration only has to miss one. All three rules are
# therefore INVERTED now: a token that this guard treats as an OPTION
# before the operand is permitted only if it is on a short allowlist of
# known-safe VALUELESS options, and is denied otherwise. No permitted
# option consumes the next token, so nothing can shift which token lands
# in the operand slot -- by construction rather than by enumeration. The
# allowlists are exact-match for long options and per-letter for short
# clusters, so an abbreviation of anything at all is denied by default
# instead of being resolved by guesswork about how the tool's parser
# would disambiguate it. node needs no allowlist because it already
# denies every option-shaped token before the script path, which is the
# same property by a stricter route.
#
# The ADR-0018 rules need no position argument of this kind. uv's target
# is the first word without a dash because every uv option allowed
# before it is valueless; pytest, ruff and git add/commit/merge check
# every word, whether or not the tool will read it as some option's
# value; and make takes exactly one word. Their option allowlists are
# exact-match, so no abbreviation is resolved by guesswork there either.
#
# "Treats as an option" is deliberately not the same as "starts with a
# dash", because the tools do not agree that it is either. A bare `-` is
# an OPERAND to sed -- sed reads it as its script, or as the stdin file
# once it has a script -- so check_sed classifies it as one too, which is
# why `sed - 1,40p FILE` is denied (the script is `-`, which is not a
# print-only script, and sed likewise errors on it) while
# `sed -n 1,40p -` is allowed. git and node have no such case: a bare `-`
# is not meaningful to either in that position and both deny it.
#
# The goal behind all of this is that the guard's model of where the
# operand is should match the tool's, whichever way that cuts, because a
# disagreement means the guard vetted a different token from the one the
# tool will act on. For sed's script slot that was checked exhaustively,
# token class by token class, against GNU sed 4.9: an allowed valueless
# option, a safe short cluster, the first `--`, a second `--`, a bare `-`
# before or after the script, an empty token, a denied option before or
# after the script, `--` after the script, and a second candidate script.
# In every one of those the guard's script token is the token sed uses.
# Two of them were found by getting it wrong first: `-e`/`-f` would make
# sed's first operand a FILE rather than the script (`sed -n -e 1p 2p f`
# reports "can't read 2p"), which is why the option allowlist has to
# exclude them, and only the FIRST `--` ends option parsing, so a second
# one is the script and not a separator. Those are all POSITION rows --
# which token. The two rows where the token is the same but its exact
# characters are not follow next.
#
# TWO text divergences remain in sed's script slot. Read that count as a
# statement about what is left, not as a claim that nothing else was ever
# wrong: brace expansion was a third divergence of an entirely different
# kind, between the guard's string and the string bash hands the tool, it
# did NOT fail closed -- it was a live write-and-exec bypass -- and it is
# now rejected outright rather than reasoned about (see BASH EXPANSIONS).
# What follows is scoped to the two remaining cases, both of them text
# rather than position: the guard and sed pick the same token as the
# script but not always the same characters in it. Both were run; neither
# can be turned into a write or an exec, and the bound is narrow enough
# to state exactly.
#
#   1. Whitespace joining. Segment splitting is whitespace-based and
#      quote-blind, so where bash joins a word -- `sed -n 1p\ w/tmp/x f`
#      passes sed the single script `1p w/tmp/x` -- the guard sees only
#      `1p` and shape-checks that. Here its script is a prefix of sed's.
#   2. Token normalization. normalize_token deletes every `'`, `"` and
#      `\`, which is load-bearing for the option rules (see TOKEN
#      NORMALIZATION above), but bash keeps those characters when they
#      are themselves quoted. So `sed -n '"1p"' FILE` is allowed: the
#      guard shape-checks `1p` while sed's script is literally `"1p"` and
#      it dies with "unknown command: `\"'". Here the guard's script is
#      NOT a prefix of sed's -- it is sed's with those characters
#      deleted, wherever they sat.
#
# Why neither reaches a write or an exec. The print-only shape admits
# only `N[,M]p` and `/re/p`, so the only letters the guard can have
# approved are `p` and whatever sits inside the regex of `/re/p`. Neither
# divergence can introduce a letter: joining appends text that sed then
# refuses, and normalization only ever DELETES `'`, `"` and `\`, so every
# letter and every `/` in sed's script is also in the guard's, in the
# same order. That is the crux, because `w`, `W`, `r`, `R`, `e` and the
# `s` command are all letters -- none of them can appear in sed's script
# unless it already got past the shape check. A letter inside `/re/p`
# could only become a command if the address delimiters were re-cut,
# which needs a `/` (never inserted -- the positions are identical) or a
# `\` escaping a delimiter, and that yields "unterminated address regex".
# And sed's only command separators, `;` and a newline, never reach
# check_sed at all: `;` splits the command into segments that must each
# pass on their own, and a newline anywhere rejects the whole command.
# Everything else appended or re-inserted is the same print, a parse
# error ("extra characters after command", "unexpected `}'",
# "unterminated address regex") or a `#` comment. All of those were run:
# nothing was written. So both divergences are real, bounded and fail
# closed. This is not a claim that the two models always agree on the
# script's text, and `sed -n '"1p"' FILE` being allowed is a recorded
# consequence of divergence 2, not a shape to rely on.
#
# FOR A LITERAL POLICY NEITHER DIVERGENCE CAN OCCUR, and that replaces
# the bound above rather than leaning on it. Divergence 1 needs a word
# joined across a blank, which takes a quote or a backslash; divergence 2
# needs a quote or backslash that bash keeps. LITERAL_ONLY='1' refuses
# all three characters, so normalize_token is a no-op and the token every
# rule reasons about is, character for character, the token the tool
# gets. That is not merely tidier: the ADR-0018 rules RELAX or VET on
# what they see ("read-only because --check is present", "this pytest
# operand is a test file"), and for such a rule a quote-blind divergence
# would fail OPEN -- in `ruff format x\ --check .` the guard would see
# `--check` while ruff got the one operand `x --check` and wrote files.
# That is why those rules exist only in literal mode.
#
# Caveat (documented, not a bug): this guard inspects the command STRING.
# It is default-deny and it blocks the obvious and the moderately clever,
# but a command-string guard is not a kernel sandbox and must not be
# described as one. Its guarantee is also only as strong as the binaries
# on the allowlist: every allowed command must itself be incapable of
# writing files or executing arbitrary code, or be fenced by a rule here.
#
# KNOWN COMMANDS (ADR-0018 decision 4). The script carries the list of
# commands it knows how to vet: KNOWN_RULE_CMDS (`find git node rg sed
# sort file uv make`, each with a rule) and KNOWN_READONLY_CMDS (`ls cat
# head tail wc stat grep jq diff cmp pwd`, read-only by construction). A
# command on a policy's ALLOW_CMDS that is on neither is refused with a
# configuration error, whatever its arguments. So adding `awk`,
# `python3`, `perl`, `xargs`, `env`, `tee` or any shell to ALLOW_CMDS no
# longer voids the guarantee silently -- it gets that command refused.
# What voids the guarantee now is adding a name to one of those two lists
# (or a target to UV_RUN_KNOWN_TARGETS) without the rules that make it
# safe: one such entry can do everything the rest of this script exists
# to prevent.
#
# Two known limits are not fixable at the token level: `git` executes
# programs named by its on-disk configuration (core.pager, core.editor,
# diff.external, textconv filters) even with `-c` blocked on the command
# line, so it is only as safe as the config in the repository it runs in;
# and the guard vouches for WHICH script `node` runs, never for what that
# script does. Keep the Bash tool off any agent whose boundary must be a
# hard one.
#
# FOR AN AGENT THAT WRITES CODE THIS IS A TRIPWIRE, NOT A BOUNDARY
# (ADR-0018 decision 1). No Bash policy can stop such an agent from
# running arbitrary code, and a policy that lets it run the gates does
# not try. pytest imports the test modules, the conftest files and the
# implementation they import; mypy loads the plugins its configuration
# names; make runs whatever the Makefile recipe says; uv installs what
# pyproject.toml and uv.lock describe. The agent writes that
# implementation and may edit that configuration, so it can put code in
# one of those files and run a gate, and nothing in `uv run --locked
# pytest -q` shows what that will execute. What such a policy does
# instead: it refuses every route that needs no file edit first
# (interpreters, heredocs, installs, network clients, options that write
# files or load code, launchers pointed at anything but the named tools,
# commands this script has no model for); together with the Edit/Write
# fence it makes the remaining routes leave evidence in `git diff` or
# `git status`; and in stop-and-report mode every refusal says that
# reaching the same effect another way is circumvention. It does not see
# what a gate executes, it does not preserve evidence (an edit, a gate run
# and a revert leave nothing in the files), it does not confine Edit or
# Write to the worktree, and it does not restrict reading. Only an
# OS-enforced sandbox would be a boundary.

# 212KB file, and `rg hello {--pre,./pre.sh} f.txt` was approved and
# executed the script. No per-command rule can catch this, because the
# dangerous word does not exist yet when the rules run.
#
# Both braces are refused wherever they appear, quoted or not. The guard
# cannot distinguish them: quotes are deleted before any comparison (see
# TOKEN NORMALIZATION), so `'a{2,3}'`, which bash leaves alone, and
# `a{2,3}`, which bash expands, are the same string by the time any rule
# could look. Fail-closed is the only available answer, and the cost is
# real rather than theoretical -- but it is smaller than it first looks,
# and the deny reason has to say so, because that text is read by an
# agent deciding whether to abandon a finding. What is genuinely lost and
# what is not, all of it run rather than reasoned about:
#
#   * Searching for a literal brace still WORKS, via a hex escape, which
#     puts no brace in the command string at all: `rg -n '\x7b\x7d'
#     services` matches `interface{}`. A pattern written with the braces
#     themselves (`'interface\{\}'`) is refused, and so is the
#     character-class dodge `[{]`, since that contains one too -- but the
#     escape is a complete substitute for the search case.
#   * grep needs `-P` for that. grep's default syntax does not implement
#     `\x`: BRE and ERE read `\x7b` as the three letters `x7b`, so
#     `grep '\x7b'` silently matches the WRONG thing instead of failing
#     (verified -- it matched a file containing the text "x7b"). Only
#     `grep -P '\x7b'` matches a brace. A workaround that fails loudly is
#     fine; one that quietly matches something else is a trap, so this
#     distinction belongs in the deny reason.
#   * Regex QUANTIFIERS are genuinely lost. There is no escape route,
#     because a hex escape is a literal: `'a\x7b2,3\x7d'` matches the
#     text `a{2,3}` rather than repeating an `a` (verified). Write the
#     repetition out longhand with `?` -- `aaa?` for `a{2,3}`, `aaaa?a?`
#     for `a{3,5}`. NOT an alternation: `rg 'aa|aaa'` is refused too,
#     because a `|` is a segment separator to this quote-blind guard
#     (verified -- an earlier draft of the deny reason recommended
#     exactly that and would have sent the agent to a second dead end).
#   * jq is barely affected, and an earlier version of this passage was
#     wrong to say object construction "has no brace-free form" -- that
#     generalised from two routes that do not work to all routes, which
#     is the same mistake in the opposite direction. Reading is
#     unaffected (`.name`, `.a.b`, `to_entries`), and objects can be
#     built without a brace by the functions that return one:
#     `jq -c 'with_entries(select(.key=="a"))'` and `jq -c 'del(.b)'`
#     both emit objects and are both allowed here (verified). What does
#     not work: a `{` escape yields a brace inside a string value
#     rather than jq syntax, `from_entries` will not take plain pairs,
#     and the `to_entries | map(...) | from_entries` pipeline is refused
#     by this guard over the `|` rather than over any brace (all
#     verified). Only jq's literal `{...}` object syntax is unavailable.
#
# If even that is not good enough for some future agent, the answer is
# not to relax this check but to give that agent a tool whose arguments
# do not pass through a shell.
if [[ "$command_str" == *'{'* || "$command_str" == *'}'* ]]; then

Braces are refused whether or not they are quoted, because quotes are stripped before any comparison and the guard therefore cannot tell an expanding brace from a literal one. You can still do almost everything, with three workarounds, all verified: to SEARCH for a literal brace use a hex escape, which puts no brace in the command -- rg -n '\\x7b\\x7d' services does match interface{} -- and with grep you must add -P, because grep's default syntax reads \\x7b as the three letters x7b and would silently match the wrong thing rather than failing. For a regex QUANTIFIER there is no escape route, because a hex escape is a literal: 'a\\x7b2,3\\x7d' matches the text a{2,3} rather than repeating an a. Write the repetition out longhand with '?' instead -- 'aaa?' for a{2,3}, 'aaaa?a?' for a{3,5}. Do not reach for an alternation: a '|' in the pattern is a segment separator to this guard, which is quote-blind, so 'aa|aaa' is refused as well. For jq, read with path expressions such as 'jq .name' or 'jq .a.b', enumerate fields with 'jq to_entries', and build a reduced object without any brace using the functions that return one: 'jq -c with_entries(select(.key==\"a\"))' and 'jq -c del(.b)' both emit objects and are both allowed here (verified). The 'to_entries | map(...) | from_entries' pipeline works in jq but this guard refuses it over the '|', not the braces.

# `sed -n '1e printf PWNED' FILE` runs printf. Both were verified against
# GNU sed 4.9. There is no sound way to validate an arbitrary sed script
# from token text, so sed is allowed in ONE shape: a print-only script,
# `N,Mp` / `Np` (`sed -n 1,40p FILE`) or `/re/p` (`sed -n /warn/p FILE`),
# with -i, -e and -f -- and their clusters and abbreviations -- denied.
#
# An earlier version had a second arm that accepted any script when
# `--sandbox` was present, on the grounds that sed itself then refuses
# e/r/w. That arm was REMOVED deliberately, and should not be
# reintroduced: its safety depended on sed parsing `--sandbox` as an
# option, and `sed -n -- '1e printf PWNED' --sandbox FILE` defeats it,
# because after `--` sed reads `--sandbox` as a filename and never enters

# takes `1,40p` as the value of `-l` without complaint, so

# `--` handling: git rejects `git -- log` outright ("unknown option: --",

# subcommand, `--` is the ordinary pathspec separator and is left alone,
# which keeps `git log -- FILE` working.
#
# Git's GLOBAL options -- the ones before the subcommand -- are handled by
# an ALLOWLIST of valueless flags, and every other dashed token in that
# position is denied. This is the fail-closed inversion of a rule that
# broke twice while it enumerated dangerous globals instead. The reason
# enumeration cannot work here is positional, not a matter of finding the
# right list: a global that takes a VALUE swallows the next token, so
# `git --namespace log -c diff.external=SCRIPT diff HEAD~1` had git
# consume `log` as the value of --namespace while the guard booked `log`
# as the subcommand, declared itself past the pre-subcommand checks, and
# let `-c` through to execute SCRIPT. Verified; it really did run.
#
# With the allowlist, no option that takes a value can precede the
# subcommand at all, so the first non-dash token really is the
# subcommand and the position check underneath it is sound by
# construction. Post-subcommand behaviour is unchanged: `-c` there is the
# harmless combined-diff flag, `-p` is --patch, and `git log -h` prints
# plain usage, so all three stay allowed.
