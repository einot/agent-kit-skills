# Generic PreToolUse path guard shared by this project's subagents
# (.claude/agents/*.md). One hook entry carries one agent's policy, set as
# env vars inline on the hook's own command line, so the same script is
# parametrized per-agent instead of duplicating the logic five times. See
# WIRING below for where that entry goes -- it is not the agent file.
#
# RULE IDs. Citations of the form "ADR-0018 decision N" name rules in the
# design record of the project this kit was extracted from. They are kept
# as stable identifiers rather than removed: the kit's behaviour tests
# (tests/hooks/) cite the same numbers, so a failing test and the rule it
# exercises stay cross-referenced. Every rule's rationale is restated in
# this header; the record itself is not needed to understand it.
#
# Env vars. The three glob lists are space-separated and use
# `[[ str == pattern ]]` semantics, so a bare `*` in a pattern matches
# across `/` too — "docs/*" matches "docs/spec/overview.md":
#
#   EXEMPT_GLOBS      - path matching any of these is always ALLOWED,
#                       checked before DENY_GLOBS/ALLOW_GLOBS.
#   DENY_GLOBS        - path matching any of these (and not exempt) is
#                       DENIED.
#   ALLOW_GLOBS       - if set, a path that is not exempt/already-denied
#                       must match at least one of these or it is DENIED
#                       (allowlist mode). Leave unset for denylist-only
#                       mode.
#   SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES - agent types this policy applies to, matched
#                       against the payload's `agent_type`. A list of
#                       exact names, not globs. Unset or empty polices
#                       every call that reaches this hook (the historical
#                       behaviour). Set polices only the listed agents and
#                       passes every other caller through untouched. See
#                       WIRING below -- this exists because the hook has
#                       to be installed session-wide.
#   PATH_ROOT         - the root every guarded path must lie inside, and
#                       that the glob lists are written relative to (see
#                       ROOT below). `project` is CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, `cwd`
#                       is the payload's cwd, and unset or empty keeps the
#                       two old bases, cwd then CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR. Any
#                       other value is a configuration error that refuses
#                       every in-scope call.
#
# Reads the PreToolUse JSON payload on stdin (see
# https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) and checks tool_input.file_path,
# falling back to tool_input.path (Grep/Glob). A payload the guard cannot
# read is refused first of all, for every caller (see A GUARD THAT FAILS
# DENIES below). For an in-scope call under a guarded policy, a path
# containing a NUL byte, or a path field that is not a string, is refused
# before any other check (see NUL GATE below), and a Glob pattern or Grep
# glob outside a narrow grammar right after it (see SEARCH PATTERNS
# below). A path that is not in plain form is then refused, and after it a
# path that does not lie inside the policy's root, before any glob list is
# consulted (see PLAIN FORM and ROOT below).
#
# A GUARD THAT FAILS DENIES (ADR-0018 decision 19, fifth amendment). This
# script ends with status 0 (allow, with no output) or 2 (deny) and nothing
# else. Before this, any command that failed under `set -e` -- an
# extraction line whose jq could not read the payload, or the jq inside
# `deny` -- ended the script with some other status, which the harness
# treats as a non-blocking hook error, so the call went through. Three
# parts, built in for every policy, with no knob:
#
#   FAIL-CLOSED EXIT. An EXIT trap, installed as the first command after
#   `set -f -e -u -o pipefail`, turns any exit status other than 0 or 2
#   into the backstop denial ("... the guard stopped with status N before
#   reaching a verdict ...") and exit 2. It writes the JSON deny with
#   printf and a fixed template, never with jq, which may be what failed.
#
#   DENY'S FALLBACK. `deny` still writes the JSON deny with `jq -n` and
#   exits 2. If that jq fails, it writes the same reason to stderr instead,
#   and still exits 2, which blocks whether or not JSON is printed.
#
#   PAYLOAD SHAPE. Between reading stdin and the first extraction line, one
#   `jq -e -s` call over the raw payload asks whether it is malformed. It
#   is well formed when it is exactly one JSON value, that value is an
#   object, its tool_input is an object, its tool_name is a string, and its
#   cwd and agent_type are each a string, null or absent. Only status 1 (a
#   clean false: well formed) passes; status 0 (malformed) and any other
#   status (not JSON, or jq failed) get the shape denial ("... could not be
#   read as a single tool call ..."), which names the status and goes
#   through `deny`. This is the one check in the script that runs BEFORE
#   the SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES routing, for every caller the hook sees, the
#   top-level session included, and under a policy that constrains
#   nothing: the routing reads agent_type through an extraction line, so a
#   script that cannot read the payload cannot tell whether the caller is
#   in scope. `deny` is therefore defined above the extraction lines. A
#   field inside tool_input is not this check's business: a path that is
#   not a string still meets the NUL gate's could-not-be-checked denial.
#   Once the shape passes, no extraction line can fail on the payload, only
#   through the environment, and the trap turns that into the backstop
#   denial.
#
#   The cost: a missing or broken jq now refuses every call this hook sees,
#   the top-level session's included, until jq is restored from outside
#   the session. A guard process that never finishes (killed by a signal
#   or by the hook timeout), or a hook command that cannot start, is
#   outside what the script can do.
#
# NUL GATE (ADR-0018 decision 17, third amendment).
#
# The path is read into file_path through a command substitution, and
# bash's command substitution silently drops NUL bytes. So `uv.lock`, a
# NUL, then `.py` would be vetted as `uv.lock.py`, and a path, a NUL, then
# `/tests/x` as a path inside a tests directory, while a harness that acted
# on the bytes before the NUL would use a different path from the one
# vetted. The gate therefore does not trust file_path: it asks jq, over the
# raw payload, whether the DECODED path -- the very value the extraction
# selects, tool_input.file_path falling back to tool_input.path -- contains
# codepoint 0, and reads the answer from jq's exit status rather than from
# any captured string.
#
# It runs for every in-scope call under a guarded policy (DENY_GLOBS or
# ALLOW_GLOBS set), whatever the tool: it does not look at tool_name. It
# sits after the SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES routing, so an out-of-scope caller
# still passes through untouched, and it does not run under a policy that
# constrains no paths, which still denies nothing. It sits before the
# empty-path check and every glob list, EXEMPT_GLOBS included.
#
# Status rule: only status 1 (`jq -e` on a clean `false`: a string with no
# NUL, the empty string included) passes. Status 0 (a NUL was found) is
# refused with the NUL denial. Any other status means the check did not
# complete -- for example the error `explode` raises on a path field that
# is `true`, a number, an array or an object -- and is refused with the
# could-not-be-checked denial, which names the status. An absent, null or
# false path becomes the empty string through `// ""`, passes, and meets
# the empty-path check as before. There is no knob to turn the gate off.
#
# PLAIN FORM (ADR-0018 decision 18, fourth amendment).
#
# The globs are matched against the path exactly as written. The script
# resolves no `.` or `..` and expands no `~`: the relativisation below only
# strips a root prefix. So `tests/../packages/x.py` would match `tests/*`
# while the kernel opened `packages/x.py`. The rule therefore refuses,
# rather than normalises, any path that is not in plain form, which is any
# path that:
#
#   1. has a `/`-separated component that is exactly `..`;
#   2. has a component that is exactly `.`;
#   3. contains `//` anywhere;
#   4. begins with `~`.
#
# Only a component that is exactly `.` or `..` counts: `.git`, `..foo`,
# `x..y` and `...` are ordinary names. A leading `/` and a single trailing
# `/` are plain. Relative paths are judged by the same four tests, so the
# rule needs no base and reads neither cwd nor CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR.
#
# It runs for every in-scope call under a guarded policy, whatever the
# tool: it does not look at tool_name. It sits after the NUL gate, the
# empty-path check, the relativisation and the project-root check, and
# before every glob list, EXEMPT_GLOBS included. The root's own spellings
# (`<root>`, `<root>/`, `<root>/.`, `<root>/./`, `.` and `./`) are handled
# by the project-root check as before and never reach the rule. There is
# no knob to turn it off.
#
# Symlinks are not handled: a path in plain form can still name, through
# a symlink among its components, a file the globs never see. The guard
# matches strings and does not touch the filesystem (ADR-0018 decision 18,
# Question 5).
#
# SEARCH PATTERNS (ADR-0018 decision 21, fifth amendment).
#
# The path of a Grep or a Glob is vetted, but the pattern it applies under
# that path could name files outside it: a Glob of the exempt `tests` with
# the pattern `../../packages/**/*.py`. The value judged is
# tool_input.pattern when tool_name is Glob, and tool_input.glob when it is
# Grep; any other tool has none, and Grep's `pattern`, a regular
# expression, is not read. It passes when it is absent, null or false, or
# a string that:
#
#   1. contains only ASCII letters, digits and the characters _ - . / * ?;
#   2. does not begin with `/`;
#   3. does not contain `..` anywhere.
#
# Anything else -- braces, ranges, negation, a leading `~`, a NUL, a
# newline, or a value that is not a string -- is refused with the pattern
# denial ("... a Glob pattern or a Grep glob may contain only ..."). Such a
# pattern can only name paths under the searched path, in any engine that
# separates on `/` and goes up only by `..`, and it has no expansion to
# build a `..` from. The check runs entirely in jq over the raw payload and
# is read from jq's exit status; only status 1 passes.
#
# It runs for every in-scope call under a guarded policy, directly after
# the NUL gate and before the empty-path check and every glob list,
# EXEMPT_GLOBS included. There is no knob to turn it off.
#
# ROOT (ADR-0018 decision 20, fifth amendment).
#
# Every glob list is written relative to a root, and a path outside it
# would be judged by patterns never written for it: `*/tests/*` matched
# `/tmp/tests/x`, and a list of repository prefixes did not match a Grep of
# the directory above the project. So under a guarded policy a path must
# lie inside the policy's root, which PATH_ROOT names:
#
#   PATH_ROOT   the root                 inside the root
#   project     CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR       an absolute path equal to the
#                                        root or beginning with the root
#                                        and `/`; a relative path only
#                                        when the payload's cwd equals the
#                                        root
#   cwd         the payload's cwd        an absolute path equal to the
#                                        root or beginning with the root
#                                        and `/`; any relative path
#   unset/empty cwd, then                an absolute path inside either
#               CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR       usable base; a relative path
#               (which falls back to     only when cwd is usable, or cwd
#               cwd), as before          is empty and CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
#                                        is usable
#   other       none                     a configuration error: every
#                                        in-scope call is refused
#
# One trailing `/` is removed from a root, and from cwd before it is
# compared with a root. The last column assumes a usable root. A root is
# usable when it begins with `/`, is in plain form by decision 18's four
# tests, and is not `/`, the one such root that is empty once its one
# trailing `/` is removed. Any other root is treated as an empty root,
# whatever the reason: its variable unset or empty, `/`, `//`, `/.`,
# `/x/..`, a relative path, or anything else out of plain form. An empty
# root contains no path, absolute or relative: every guarded path is
# outside it. So under `project` a CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, and under `cwd` a
# cwd, that is not usable puts every guarded path outside the root. With
# PATH_ROOT unset, an absolute path is compared only with a base that is
# usable; a relative path is inside only when cwd is usable, or when cwd
# is empty and CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is usable; and with no usable base the
# root is empty. cwd is empty when the payload's cwd is absent, null or
# the empty string, and CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR when it is unset or empty. The
# usability test is applied to the value as given, before its trailing
# `/` is removed. The relativisation strips
# the root (or, unset, the two
# bases in turn) and does nothing else; the path relative to the root is
# what the glob lists see, and a relative path is kept as written.
#
# The value of PATH_ROOT is checked right after the SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES
# routing and before `guarded` is worked out, so an invalid value refuses
# every in-scope call, guarded or not, while an out-of-scope caller passes
# through untouched. The relativisation keeps its place after the
# empty-path check. The root rule itself runs only under a guarded policy,
# after the plain-form rule (so a path out of plain form keeps that denial)
# and before every glob list, EXEMPT_GLOBS included; it refuses with the
# root denial ("... is not inside this policy's root directory ..."). The
# project root's own spellings are handled by the project-root check,
# before the rule, as before. Only a usable root has spellings of its own
# there. The relativisation strips only a usable root or base, so the
# check, which reads `rel`, fires for an absolute path only when it spells
# a usable one: `<root>`, `<root>/`, `<root>/.` or `<root>/./`. Under a
# root that is not usable, an absolute path keeps its form, and one in
# plain form reaches the root rule: with CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR and cwd both
# `/` under PATH_ROOT='project', a Grep of `/` gets the root denial, not
# the project-root denial. The relative spellings `.` and `./` are never
# relativised, since a usable root or base is absolute, and keep the
# check's handling whatever the root: a Read, Grep or Glob of either gets
# the project-root denial, and an Edit or Write exits 0. No knob turns the
# rule off: PATH_ROOT
# chooses the root, not whether there is one. A path inside the root that
# leads outside it through a symlink is not handled (Question 5).
#
# WIRING -- read this before believing the guard is doing anything.
#
# This hook must be wired in `.claude/settings.json` (or
# `.claude/settings.local.json`). It must NOT be wired in an agent file's
# `hooks:` frontmatter. `hooks:` is a documented frontmatter field, but
# a guard declared there did not fire in this environment: tested
# three times, including with an absolute script path -- no error, no
# warning, nothing to notice, so the agent ran completely unfenced
# (three probes). The best-supported explanation is the documented
# requirement that a project-level agent's frontmatter hooks run only
# once the workspace trust dialog has been accepted for the folder
# containing the agent file; this session has no trust record for the
# project. That has not been confirmed directly. Either way the
# consequence is the same: whether a frontmatter guard fires depends on
# environment state that is invisible from the repository, so it can
# look enforced on one machine and silently do nothing on another.
# `.claude/settings.json` hooks fired in every test -- see also WIRING
# in bash-guard.sh.
#
# WHERE THE CONFIGURATION IS READ FROM. Hook configuration is read from
# the main project checkout, not from a subagent's worktree. A
# worktree-isolated agent is fenced by whatever the main checkout's
# `.claude/settings.json` contains at dispatch time; the copy in its
# worktree is inert. So to test a policy change, the change must be in
# the main checkout, and a probe dispatched right after editing tests
# the edited policy -- not whatever the worktree has checked out.
# Established by experiment: with the policy removed from the main
# checkout only, while the worktree copy still carried it, the write
# was not denied.
#
# Settings-level hooks are session-wide: they fire for every agent and for
# the top-level session, not only the agent a policy was written for. That
# is what SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES is for. One entry still carries one policy,
# because the env vars come from the hook's own command line, so two
# agents needing different globs need two entries. Two entries whose
# SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES overlap both run, and the stricter one's denial wins,
# since any deny is final.
#
# The scoping is FAIL-OPEN by design: an absent or unlisted agent_type
# means "not my business", not "deny" -- a top-level call carries no
# agent_type at all. It is routing, not a check, so an exit 0 for an
# out-of-scope caller is not approval, only a statement that this policy
# did not apply. See "SCOPING IS FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN" in bash-guard.sh for
# why a stricter rule would break the session it was installed in without
# being a boundary for anyone.
#
# Unscoped content tools are DENIED for guarded agents. Grep and Glob take
# an optional `path`; without one they search the whole project, and
# Grep's `output_mode: content` then returns matching lines from files the
# guard is supposed to hide. Passing such a call through (as this script
# did before) made the guard advisory rather than enforced. A guarded
# agent must therefore name an in-scope path it wants to search. The same
# applies to a `path` that resolves to the project root itself.
#
# Caveat (documented, not a bug): this only intercepts the tool calls named
# in the subagent's own `matcher` (Edit|Write or Read|Grep|Glob). It does
# NOT inspect Bash commands, so an agent that also has the Bash tool could
# still read or write a guarded path via a shell command. Keep Bash off
# any agent whose guard must be a hard boundary, or treat the guard as a
# strong default rather than a sandbox for agents that keep Bash.

# Normalize to a path relative to the policy's root (ADR-0018 decision 20;

# inside it. Under PATH_ROOT='project' the root is CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR,
# under PATH_ROOT='cwd' the payload's cwd, and unset or empty keeps the two
# old bases, cwd then CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (which falls back to cwd), tried
# in turn. A root or base is used only when it is usable (usable_root:
# it begins with `/`, is in plain form by decision 18's four tests, and is
# not `/`); any other one, unset or empty included, is treated as an empty
# root, skipped, and contains no path. Its one trailing `/` is removed only
# after that test. Note the exact-match arm:
# without it, a path equal to the root itself fell through with `rel`
# still absolute and matched no glob at all. This only strips a prefix; it
# resolves no `.`, `..` or `//` and expands no `~`. A path out of plain
# form is refused by the rule below (see PLAIN FORM in the header).
#
# A relative path is kept as written and judged relative to the root:
# under `cwd` inside only when cwd is usable; under `project` only when
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is usable and the payload's cwd equals it, one
# trailing `/` removed from each (the harness resolves a relative path
# against cwd); and when PATH_ROOT is unset only when cwd is usable, or
# when cwd is empty and CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is usable. With no usable base
# the root is empty and contains no path. Under `project` and `cwd` only
# an absolute path is compared with the root; unset keeps the old
# comparison for every path, against usable bases only. Since a usable
# root is absolute, `.` and `./` are never relativised and keep the
# project-root check's handling whatever the root.
