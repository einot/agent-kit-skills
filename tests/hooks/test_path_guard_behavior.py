"""Behaviour of `.claude/hooks/path-guard.sh`, the subagent path guard.

The companion module `test_agent_hook_wiring.py` checks that the guard is wired
somewhere it actually fires. This one checks what it does once it is: the script
is run as a real subprocess, fed a PreToolUse JSON payload on stdin and
parametrised through the same env-var assignments a policy in
`.claude/settings.json` puts on its command line.

The contract (see the script's own header, and issue #102):

* exit 0 allows the tool call; exit 2 denies it and writes a JSON object on
  stdout whose `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` is `"deny"`.
* `EXEMPT_GLOBS` wins over `DENY_GLOBS`; `ALLOW_GLOBS`, when set, turns the
  policy into an allowlist. Paths are matched relative to the payload's `cwd`
  or to `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, with `[[ str == pattern ]]` glob semantics, so a
  bare `*` matches across `/` too.
* An unscoped `Grep`/`Glob` -- no `path` in the payload, or a `path` that is the
  project root -- is denied for a guarded agent. Without that, a guarded agent
  reads restricted content simply by searching the whole project.
* `SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES` routes a session-wide policy at the agent it was written
  for, matching the payload's `agent_type`. Routing is deliberately FAIL-OPEN:
  an absent or unrecognised `agent_type` means "not my policy", not "deny". An
  exit 0 for an out-of-scope caller is therefore not approval, and the tests
  that encode it are encoding a design decision rather than a bug.

The last group of tests runs the policies as they are actually configured in
`.claude/settings.json`, so a typo in a glob list fails here even though the
wiring tests see a perfectly well-formed entry.

ADR-0018 (`docs/adr/0018-coder-bash-policy-literal-commands-and-a-tripwire.md`)
decision 12 widens the coder's Edit/Write fence: agent configuration and
governance, git's internals, ignored executed state (`.venv/`, `__pycache__/`),
files that tools find by name, and `uv.lock`. The coder cases added to
`WRITE_CASES` and the worktree cases below encode it; they fail until the
top-level session applies decision 14 (step W).

ADR-0018 decision 17 (third amendment) adds a NUL gate to the script. The path
is read through a command substitution, which drops NUL bytes, so the guard used
to vet a path with every NUL removed: `uv.lock`, a NUL, then `.py` was vetted,
and allowed, as `uv.lock.py`. The gate runs after the `SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES`
routing, only under a guarded policy, and before the empty-path check and every
glob list. A path containing a NUL is refused with the NUL denial; a path that
is `true`, a number, an array or an object is refused with the
could-not-be-checked denial; an absent, `null` or `false` path behaves as
before. The tests at the end of this module encode it. Those that expect a NUL
or non-string refusal fail until brief C4 lands.

ADR-0018 decision 18 (fourth amendment) requires a guarded path to be in plain
form. The guard matches a path exactly as written and resolves nothing, so a
path such as `<repo>/tests/../packages/x.py` used to match the test-author's
`tests/*` and reach a file its policy guards. A path is out of plain form when
one of its `/`-separated components is exactly `.` or `..`, when it contains
`//`, or when its first character is `~`. Such a path is refused with the
plain-form denial, whatever it would resolve to, even when its target is in
scope; `..foo`, `x..y`, `...` and `.hidden` are ordinary names. The rule runs
after the routing, only under a guarded policy, after decision 17's NUL gate
and the project-root check, and before every glob list. The tests after
decision 17's encode it. Those that expect the plain-form denial fail until
brief C5 lands.

ADR-0018's fifth amendment adds decisions 19-22. Decision 19: a payload the
guard cannot read as one tool call (not exactly one JSON object, a `tool_input`
that is not an object, a `tool_name` that is not a string, a `cwd` or
`agent_type` that is neither a string nor `null`) is refused with the shape
denial, before the routing, for every caller and under every policy; and a
guard that would end with any status other than 0 or 2 denies instead, with
the backstop denial. Decision 20: under a guarded policy a path must lie inside
the policy's root, which `PATH_ROOT` names (`project`, `cwd`, or unset for the
two bases the guard always used); any other value is a configuration error.
Decision 21: a Glob `pattern` or a Grep `glob` may hold only letters, digits
and `_ - . / * ?`, may not begin with `/` and may not contain `..`. Decision 22
changes the configured lists, which the top-level session applies in step W.
The tests after decision 18's encode them (brief T4). Those for decisions 19-21
fail until brief C6 lands, except their controls; those that read the
configured policies after step W fail until W, except the cases marked as
holding after C6, which fail only until C6 lands.

ADR-0018's sixth amendment (2026-09-25) closes two gaps. Decision 22's read
deny list for the test-author, which decision 14's text carries into step W,
gains the caches of Hypothesis, pytest, ruff and uv, `.git`, coverage's data
files and `snapshots`, each with what lies under it. Decision 20 gains a usable
root: one that begins with `/`, is in plain form by decision 18's four tests,
and is not `/`. Any other root (`/`, `//`, `/.`, one with a `..` component, a
relative one) is an empty root that contains no path, so under PATH_ROOT
`project` or `cwd` every guarded path is refused with the root denial,
unchanged. With PATH_ROOT unset an absolute path is compared only with a usable
base, and a relative path is inside only when `cwd` is usable, or `cwd` is empty
and CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is usable. The tests at the end of this module encode it
(brief T5). The read list's refusals fail until step W; the root cases fail
until brief C7 lands, except their controls and the silent passes outside the
root rule's reach.

ADR-0018's seventh amendment (2026-09-25) fixes SA1f's findings. Decision 24:
a path is read from its tool's own field, `file_path` for a Read, Edit or Write
and `path` for a Grep or Glob; a call from any other tool, or one whose other
field is anything but absent, `null` or `false`, is refused, before the NUL
gate. Decision 17 gains a trailing-newline test, directly after the NUL gate.
Decision 18's fourth test refuses a `~` at the start of any component, and a
root with such a component is not usable (decision 20). Decision 23: in a Grep
or a Glob no string may begin with `-`, no component of a Glob pattern or a
Grep glob may begin with `.` and then `*` or `?`, and the search path may hold
only ASCII letters, digits and `_ - . /`. Decision 19 reads at most 8 MiB and
one byte of the payload, keeping a raw NUL as U+0002, which the shape check
refuses with status 0; it turns a status 2 that `deny` did not make into the
backstop denial; and it refuses, with the backstop denial, an extraction that
reads a field as empty that is not, and a `cwd` that ends with a newline or
holds a NUL. Decision 12 (e) and (f) add `tests`, `*/tests` and the testkit to
the coder's fence at step W. The tests at the end of this module encode them
(brief T6). They fail until brief C8 lands, except their controls and silent
passes, the raw U+0002 cases if `jq` already refuses a raw control character,
the `/dev/full` case and the `jq` killed by a signal, which pass today; the
coder's cases for decision 12 fail until step W, except their control.

ADR-0018's eighth amendment (2026-09-26) fixes SA1g's findings. Decision 26:
under a guarded policy, an in-scope call whose path begins or ends with an edge
character (U+0000-U+0020, U+007F-U+00A0, U+1680, U+180E, U+2000-U+200A,
U+2028, U+2029, U+202F, U+205F, U+3000 or U+FEFF) is refused with decision
26's denial, directly after decision 17's trailing-newline test, so before
decisions 18, 20, 21 and 23 and every glob list; a tool that trims its path
would otherwise act on a path no list judged. Such a character inside a path
is judged as written, so decision 17's control for a carriage return at the end
goes. Decision 20, "An empty `cwd`": with PATH_ROOT unset a relative path is
inside the root only when `cwd` is usable, so with `cwd` absent, `null` or
empty it gets the root denial, and T4's follow-up case `cwd-empty-dir-repo`
changes with it. Decision 25's eighth-amendment note: a coder Write whose path
has 200,000 components is decided within the helper's timeout. The tests at the
end of this module encode them (brief T7). Decision 26's refusals and its order
cases, and decision 20's refused cases, fail until brief C9 lands; their
controls and boundaries, and the long path, pass today.
