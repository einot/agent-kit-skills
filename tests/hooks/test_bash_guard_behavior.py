"""Behaviour of `.claude/hooks/bash-guard.sh` under ADR-0018's policy features.

ADR-0018 (`docs/adr/0018-coder-bash-policy-literal-commands-and-a-tripwire.md`)
gives the `coder` agent a Bash policy. It adds five knobs to the guard --
`LITERAL_ONLY`, `DENY_ADVICE`, `ALLOW_UV_RUN_TARGETS`, `ALLOW_MAKE_TARGETS` and
`WRITE_DENY_GLOBS` -- together with a built-in list of the commands the script
knows how to vet, and rules for `uv`, `make`, pytest, ruff and git's writing
subcommands. Every expectation here is taken from the ADR's decisions 3-15, never
from the script's code: the ADR is the specification, and where it and the
script's header disagree, the ADR wins.

The guard is run as a real subprocess, fed a PreToolUse JSON payload on stdin
and parametrised through the same env-var assignments a policy in
`.claude/settings.json` puts on its command line -- the same harness
`test_path_guard_behavior.py` uses for the path guard.

Groups, each citing the decision it encodes:

* A -- contract and routing (decision 11, "The guard never emits an allow
  decision"; `SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES` routing);
* B -- configuration hygiene (decisions 3, 4, 5 and 7);
* C -- literal mode (decision 3);
* D -- `uv` (decision 5), including `--locked` (step 6) and shadowing (step 4);
* E -- pytest's options and operands (decision 6);
* F -- ruff, and `WRITE_DENY_GLOBS` (decision 7);
* G -- make (decision 8);
* H -- git for the coder (decision 9);
* I -- denial advice, `DENY_ADVICE` (decision 11);
* J -- the incident (decision 1's table), against the configured coder policy;
* K -- the policies as configured in `.claude/settings.json` (decision 14);
* O -- the NUL gate and literal-mode control characters (decisions 2, 3 and 11,
  second amendment of 2026-09-24).

Groups J and K read `.claude/settings.json`, so the coder half of them fails
until the top-level session applies decision 14 (step W). Everything else
fails until brief C1 lands. That is intended; nothing here is xfailed.

ADR-0018's fifth amendment (2026-09-25) adds decision 19, which group P
encodes (brief T4, item 7). A payload the guard cannot read as one tool call
-- not exactly one JSON object, a `tool_input` that is not an object, a
`tool_name` that is not a string, a `cwd` or `agent_type` that is neither a
string nor `null` -- is refused with the bash shape denial. The check runs
before the `SCOPE_AGENT_TYPES` routing, for every caller and under every
policy, and the denial goes through `deny`, so it carries decision 11's
paragraph exactly when the policy's `DENY_ADVICE` asks for it. A guard that
would end with any status other than 0 or 2 denies instead, with the backstop
denial, which never carries the paragraph. When `deny`'s own `jq` fails, the
reason goes to stderr and the exit is still 2. Group P fails until brief C6
lands, except its controls, which pass today. A `command` that is not a
string still meets decision 3's could-not-be-checked denial (group O).

ADR-0018's seventh amendment (2026-09-25) adds group Q (brief T6). Decision 19
as amended reads at most 8 MiB and one byte of the payload, keeping a raw NUL
as U+0002, and a payload holding a raw U+0002 gets the bash shape denial,
naming status 0; a status 2 that `deny` did not make gets the backstop denial;
and an extraction that reads a field as empty that is not, or a `cwd` that
ends with a newline or holds a NUL, is refused with the backstop denial.
Decision 25 refuses an in-scope command longer than 16384 characters, after
the routing and before literal mode, under every policy. Decision 7 refuses a
write-mode `ruff format` operand that is a directory or a symbolic link.
Decision 12 (f) puts the testkit on the coder's `WRITE_DENY_GLOBS` at step W.
Group Q fails until brief C8 lands, except its controls, the raw U+0002 cases
if `jq` already refuses a raw control character, the `/dev/full` case and the
`jq` killed by a signal, which pass today; its testkit case fails until step W.

ADR-0018's eighth amendment (2026-09-26) adds group R (brief T7). Decision 7, in
write mode: an operand less one leading `./` that has a `.` component, contains
`//` or begins with `/` is not in plain form, and is refused with the
write-mode denial, before `WRITE_DENY_GLOBS` is consulted, since the kernel
reads such a spelling as the plain file a glob would have refused; the list's
own refusal now goes through the write-mode denial too; and an operand any of
whose components is a symbolic link is refused, not only one whose last
component is. Read-only mode is unchanged. Decision 19's part 6 removes every
command substitution and here-string after the extraction check, and keeps the
splitting and normalisation each rule sees exactly as they were, which group R
pins. Group R's decision 7 cases fail until brief C9 lands, except their
controls and the target of a link, which pass today; its cases under the
configured coder policy fail until step W as well; its decision 19 cases pass
today.
